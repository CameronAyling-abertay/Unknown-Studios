Game Concept Rundown (Synopsis):

Have you ever wanted to play Cluedo and realized you don’t have enough friends? Me too. So we came up with an idea to solve that. 
So we present to you, A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing; A PC-based 2.5D murder mystery game where you, a farmer, must figure out which one 
of your sheep is actually a bloodthirsty wolf hellbent on eating your flock. Each day, you will lose a sheep and can interrogate the 
survivors about what happened overnight. Or, you can search for clues to catch who was stalking in the dark. 

Players 12+  must put on their detective hats and deduce what clues will lead to the wicked wolf hiding in your herd. During the day 
explore the open-world farm, speak with your sheep for their testimonies, and see if you’re smart enough to beat the clock and save 
your flock before night falls and the Wolf strikes again. Your time is running out, and the game is afoot. But beware - some of your 
sheep might be lying, and one of them is definitely a wolf in sheep’s clothing.
